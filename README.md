# Salvation Army Resident Services Tracker

## Overview

The Salvation Army Resident Services Tracker (SARST) is a proof-of-concept web solution which aims to help service providers and administrators at the Salvation Army to record, review, and analyze the residents, events, and services provided at SA Shelters. This web application was built, tested, and deployed solely by me over the course of about a month for my Captsone Project course at UALR.

The project was built using the C# ASP.NET framework, and is hosted through Microsoft Azure. The database is an SQL Server also hosted by Azure. No JavaScript or CSS frameworks were used in the implementation.
